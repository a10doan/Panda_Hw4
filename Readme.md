## This is a markdown file

--Synopsis--
This is the readme file for the Pymoli homework.  Pymoli is a free game where players can purchase items throughout the game.  The files we are reading are json files, where panda can read into data frames and series.
we then manipulate the data into tables and break down the data about the players and their purchase habits.  We analyze age and gender demographics, as well as popular and profitable items within the game.
--Motivation--
My motivation for this project is that it is homework, and that I want to learn python and pandas?  And to make tables so that analyzing data is easy.
--Testing--
Program was tested with both json data files.
--Contributors--
